This codebook describes the variables, data, and data cleanup used to produce the Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project.

The data for the project are downloaded from
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

The data are collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A description of the dataset is available from
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

To construct the tidyData dataset, accelerometry measurements from the test and training datasets were joined, along with participant IDs and activity descriptors. 

Variables in the dataset tidyData represent the mean calculated for each individual, for each activity type. The activity types are 
```{r}
table(tidyData$Activity)
```
