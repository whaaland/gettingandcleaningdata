# Course Project for Getting and Cleaning Data

About this project: to run this analysis, begin with data downloaded from 
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

The user must set the working directory to which the above-linked file was un-zipped. 

The script file "run_analysis.R" will carry out data merging and cleaning, resulting in a dataset called tidyData.txt that contains one row per individual per activity type. 

See CodeBook.Rmd for additional information about the dataset

Initialize library dplyr before beginning
